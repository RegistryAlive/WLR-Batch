# WLR-Batch
Batch file intended with the use of translating the game Wonderland Online Rhodes Island.

# Differences
There are other groups that are doing translation, some files that are used by those groups are files directly taken from a **Ex Translator from Islando**. This is happening even now on at least 2 or 3 files. This will not change anytime soon as they do not have the capability to update the files.

In every update, there are 3 files that are being checked. Item / aLogin / Server.INI. This means that you can simply check for updates for this 3 and completely ignore the rest for the game to work. This however results in other files being completely neglected, the other files are not up to date with the other groups.

With our group we ensure that **all files are completely up to date**, **Translations will be as accurate as possible**. Translations will be done by Members who are efficient with the Language, that will try and put the context into play. We will try and remove machine translations as much as possible. 

We will be putting forth a seperate patcher for Complete Fan Translation, that has **0** machine translation / Rubbish Translation (IGG). This however changes a ton of names that players are familiar with from IGG.
